# Hello! I'm √âim√≠. üë©üèª‚Äçüíª

- Hi! I‚Äôm √âim√≠, a 26-year-old Irish woman living in the North-East of Scotland. 
- I‚Äôm a Computing & IT and Design student at [the Open University](https://www.open.ac.uk/), with a keen interest in Accessibility, Web Development, and Design. 
- I‚Äôm passionate about the Irish language (ag foghlaim Gaeilge), European Politics, and Video Games. I‚Äôm also a proud bi woman and wheelchair user. My pronouns are She/Her (S√≠/√ç). 
- I make the occasional game mod, but I'm currently learning TypeScript and React so that I can make better web applications. 
- I don't like platform/console/OS wars, so I use a variety of devices and services, and I try to make my code cross-platform.
